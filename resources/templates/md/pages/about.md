In this blog are some of my thoughts on programming. These ideas are mostly not original.

My goal here is for you, the reader, to rapidly acquire some insights which took me a long time to achieve - and as an added benefit, 
 to gain a better grasp of these notions myself, by putting them into words.

## About me

<img src="/img/vw-rope.jpg" width="100%">

My name is **Valentin Waeselynck**, I'm a French software engineer currently living in Paris, France.

I started programming when I was 14, starting in the exotic domain of artificial life systems.
 Since then, I've been fortunate enough to tackle a broad range of problems with a wide variety of technologies and approaches,
 building modern web applications, data processing pipelines, data analysis algorithms, custom querying engines and various 
 programming tools for supporting this work. 

Lately, I have specialized in the **[Clojure](https://clojure.org/)** programming language and **[Datomic](https://www.datomic.com/)** database,
 and more generally in reactive and data-centric architectures for information systems.
 I have made a few open-source contributions in these areas, in the form of [some libraries](https://github.com/vvvvalvalval)
 and the [official Clojure REPL guide](https://clojure.org/guides/repl/introduction).
 
You may find me on the web in a few places:

Aside from programming, I enjoy mathematics, climbing mountains, and playing music. 

### Consulting

I'm available for software engineering consulting / training engagements, either on-site in the Paris area or remote.
